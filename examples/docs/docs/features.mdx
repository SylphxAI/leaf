# Features & Examples

This page demonstrates all the powerful features available in ReactPress.

## Custom Containers

ReactPress supports VitePress-style custom containers for highlighting important information.

::: tip
This is a tip container. Use it for helpful suggestions and best practices.
:::

::: warning
This is a warning container. Use it to alert users about potential issues or important considerations.
:::

::: danger STOP
This is a danger container. Use it for critical warnings about breaking changes or destructive actions.
:::

::: details Click to expand
This is a details container. Use it for optional content that users can expand when needed.

You can put any markdown content inside:

- Lists
- **Bold text**
- `Code snippets`

```typescript
const example = "code blocks work too!";
```
:::

## Code Blocks with Copy Button

All code blocks automatically get a copy button on hover:

```typescript
import { zen } from '@sylphx/zen';

const store = zen({ count: 0 });

// Hover over this code block to see the copy button!
store.set({ count: store.get().count + 1 });
```

## Code Line Highlighting

Highlight specific lines in your code blocks using `{line-numbers}` syntax:

```typescript {2,4-6}
import { zen } from '@sylphx/zen';
const store = zen({ count: 0 }); // This line is highlighted

function increment() {
  store.set({ count: store.get().count + 1 }); // Lines 4-6 highlighted
  console.log('Count updated!');
}
```

```bash
# Install packages
bun add @sylphx/zen @sylphx/craft @sylphx/silk

# Run development server
bun run dev
```

## Table of Contents

Every page automatically generates a table of contents from your headings, displayed in the right sidebar.

## Auto-Generated Sidebar

The sidebar is automatically generated from your file structure. No manual configuration needed!
